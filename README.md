Assignment 3

Write a class in java which splits words into sub-words with following conditions.
NO SPLITTING If word is alphanumeric like 3-d OR 3d
Split and create the following 2 tokens If word is all alphabets with special character in it. E.g. java/book to 
java book
SPLIT and create the following 3 tokens If word is all alphabets with special characters in it. E.g. java/book-price to 
java book price
NO SPLITTING If a phrase (string enclosed in double quotes) or delimiter is found in the token and it is alphanumeric.
E.g "ab2c-def" OR "abc-def" 
No splitting of the first part i.e. "ab2c-def"
Split second part i.e. "abc-def" to "abc def"
This class should identify all kinds of special characters, alphanumeric tokens and yields tokens as per the above logic.
